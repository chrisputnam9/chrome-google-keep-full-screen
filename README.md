## Warnings & Important Notes

 1. **Use this extension at your own risk.** It shouldn't cause problems, but I can't make any guarantees. It's wise to keep critical notes [backed up](https://support.google.com/keep/answer/10017039?hl=en).
 2. **This extension only works with the website version** of Google Keep (eg. https://keep.google.com/keep/) - it won't work with the "app" version (the one you might install and launch from your app menu -ie. for offline use).
 3. **For Firefox & Edge, see [Version 1.2.3 Documentation](https://github.com/chrisputnam9/chrome-google-keep-full-screen/tree/version-1.2.3)**. At this time, the latest version (1.3.0) is only available on Chrome due to development limitations with the other browsers.
 4. At this time, clicking the extension icon itself does not toggle anything - click the full-screen icon added to the note itself (or use the keyboard shortcut) to toggle full-screen on and off.
