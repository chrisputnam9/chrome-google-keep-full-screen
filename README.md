## Firefox Latest Version: 1.2.3

- The Firefox extension is at 1.2.3. A technical limitation prevents us from easily updating for now.

## Warnings & Important Notes

1.  **Use this extension at your own risk.** It shouldn't cause problems, but I can't make any guarantees. It's wise to keep critical notes [backed up](https://support.google.com/keep/answer/10017039?hl=en).
2.  **This extension only works with the website version** of Google Keep (ie. https://keep.google.com) - it won't work with the "app" version (the one you might install and launch from your app menu -ie. for offline use).
3.  At this time, clicking the extension icon itself does not toggle anything - click the full-screen icon added to the note itself (or use the keyboard shortcut) to toggle full-screen on and off.
