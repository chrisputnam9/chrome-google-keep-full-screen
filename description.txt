WARNINGS & IMPORTANT NOTES
 * Use this extension at your own risk. It shouldn't cause problems, but I can't make any guarantees. It's wise to keep critical notes backed up.
 * This extension only works with the website version of Google Keep (eg. https://keep.google.com/keep/) - it won't work with the "app" version (the one you might install and launch from your app menu -ie. for offline use).
 * At this time, clicking the extension icon itself does not toggle anything - click the full-screen icon added to the note itself (or use the keyboard shortcut) to toggle full-screen on and off.

INSTRUCTIONS
 * Full-screen is enabled by default when you first install the extension.
 * Use the full-screen icon at the bottom of the note to toggle full-screen on and off as needed.
 * Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut, which you can customize at 
"chrome://extensions/shortcuts"
 * Your selection will be remembered between notes and sessions.
 * Open the extension options (from a note menu, Keep menu, extension icon menu or extension page) to customize behavior.
