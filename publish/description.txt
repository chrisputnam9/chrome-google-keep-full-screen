WARNINGS & IMPORTANT NOTES
 * **Use this extension at your own risk.** It shouldn't cause problems, but I can't make any guarantees. It's wise to keep critical notes [backed up](https://support.google.com/keep/answer/10017039?hl=en).
 * **This extension only works with the website version** of Google Keep (ie. https://keep.google.com) - it won't work with the "app" version (the one you might install and launch from your app menu -ie. for offline use).
 * At this time, clicking the extension icon itself does not toggle anything - click the full-screen icon added to the note itself (or use the keyboard shortcut) to toggle full-screen on and off.

INSTRUCTIONS
 * Full-screen is enabled by default when you first install the extension.
 * Use the full-screen icon at the bottom of the note to toggle full-screen on and off as needed.
 * Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut, which you can customize at "chrome://extensions/shortcuts"
 * Your selection will be remembered between notes and sessions.
 * Open the extension options (from a note menu, Keep menu, extension icon menu or extension page) to customize behavior.
